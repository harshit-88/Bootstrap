            <p>Zumba's most well-known and popular program is its namesake class, Zumba. 
                This dance class features high- and low-intensity intervals that help improve 
                cardiovascular fitness while also enhancing balance, coordination, agility, and
                 to some degree, strength, through the application of beginner-accessible choreography.

                You don't need any special dance skills to succeed in Zumba classes but those that have
                 natural rhythm may pick up on the moves faster. Still, no one is keeping score, so just dance, let go, and have fun.
                
                Classes typically consist of a series of Latin-inspired songs, starting with a slower warm-up song,
                 building intensity throughout the workout, and ending with a cool-down song. Even if you're not a 
                 strong dancer, the choreography is repetitive and designed to be built upon, so most people will 
                 catch on to the moves as they go.
                
                In fact, a big draw of Zumba is that just about anyone can do it, and regardless of how quickly you pick up
                 on the choreography, you're likely to be having fun—and sweating. No special equipment or outfits are needed either.
                  All you need is a positive attitude and to keep moving along with each song.
                Zumba was officially founded in the United States in 2001 by Alberto "Beto" Perez, a Colombian dancer who started
                the fitness class in the '90s in his home country. Perez's "rags to riches" story could be considered serendipity—he
                 was teaching an aerobics class at his local gym when he realized he'd forgotten his usual music.
                
                Without time to retrieve his tunes, Perez ended up using a few of his favorite Latin-dance cassettes, and just like that,
                 the new class was born. It became so popular with people in Columbia, that popstar Shakira enlisted him to help choreograph 
                 some of her music.
                
                In 2000, Perez decided to launch his fitness class in the United States. In 2001, he partnered with two investors and released 
                a series of three Zumba DVDs available through an infomercial.
                
                While the class wasn't an overnight success, it gained significant steam, and by 2012 received further investment and expansion 
                with more class formats, Zumba cruises, Zumba vacations, and an extensive instructor training program.
                
                The dance fitness concept wasn't new when Zumba rose to fame, but the high energy fun of its classes was. Plus, Zumba's timing 
                was ideal. In the early 2000s, large fitness centers, like 24 Hour Fitness and Lifetime Fitness were popping up everywhere, often
                 including group fitness classes as a benefit of membership. These gyms were looking for unique classes to add to the draw of their
                 lubs.
                
                At the same time, there was a growing focus on the concept of "fitness as fun" to keep members engaged and interested. 
                Zumba effectively delivered on those needs and was overwhelmingly picked up as a regular class offering across the country. 
                As Zumba grew in popularity, it often became a driving force of gym membership and membership retention, making it a win-win
                 for all involved.</p>

            <p>When hip hop music first developed in the late 1970s, not many people knew about it. 
                It was created in the poorest districts of New York City by African American and Latino teenagers 
                as part of a hip hop scene that also produced breakdancing and graffiti art. Many of these young 
                people were unemployed, but some found work as DJs in discos where they learned deejaying techniques
                 like how to use two turntables and a DJ mixer to play records non-stop. Sometimes they'd also deejay
                  at free block parties in their neighbourhoods where they'd play funk and disco tracks non-stop and 
                  ask a friend to act as their MC. The MC would introduce the DJ and encourage everyone to dance and 
                  have a good time. Some MCs tried to be more entertaining by talking in time to the beat of the music
                   and using rhymes, and by doing this they invented rapping. As rapping became more popular, more DJ and
                    MC duos formed. As the competition grew, DJs began improving their beats by using techniques like sampling 
                    short drum breaks and scratching. MCs also began improving their raps by using more complex rhymes and by
                     developing flow, or the ability to rap with a good sense of rhythm and a natural flowing style. Hip hop 
                     music was only performed live at first, but in 1979 a hip hop single called Rapper's Delight by 
                     The Sugarhill Gang was released, and to everyone's surprise it became a top-ten hit worldwide.

                   After the success of Rapper's Delight, many other hip hop records were released like Kurtis Blow's
                    The Breaks and Afrika Bambaataa's Planet Rock. Most of these songs were about having fun, 
                    but in 1982 Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five released The Message, an early example of 
                    socially-conscious hip hop. It had a slow funk groove with melodic synthesizer riffs and the 
                    raps were about social issues like poverty, crime and the stress of living in a dangerous city.</p>

            <p>“Dancing with the Stars” is never just about the dances. While the contestants are judged and scored by 
                a panel of experts based on the quality of their routines, half of the results are determined by viewers 
                voting from home. So who stays and who goes can be quite surprising. Scroll down for the complete 
                “Dancing with the Stars” results for season 30, updated every week as celebs are sent home.

                   getting some shocking eliminations like Heather Morris and James Van Der Beek in recent seasons? Was there a
                    head-scratcher of a winner like Bobby Bones? Follow along throughout the season to find out.</p>
